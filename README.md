Much of design is about transforming the materials at hand into final products that perform tasks, respond to needs, and delight the senses. This is a class about that process: turning flat, raw materials into complex, multi dimensional forms.

This class, because of its size and nature, will be very much like a workshop -- the participants will have a lot of say in what and how it is taught.  Topics will/can range from origami and other folding techniques, to press-fit assemblies, to bending, to warping, and beyond.  Anything that talks about making what is flat into something with volume and/or form.

As this is part of FabLab CEPT, many of topics covered will uses digital fabrication techniques, though using these tools is not a requirement for a topic to be covered.

## Policies

### Attendance & Due Dates

Attendance to *all lectures* is mandatory.  

Of course, if there are circumstances that dictate, absence is acceptable if:

1. Prior notice is given **by the student him/her-self**.

2. Total number of absences throughout the semester is *reasonable* (as decided by faculty).

Submissions for work will be strict, though exceptions are possible - they will be granted according to the same criteria above.

### Grading

**All students** are expected to contribute towards the class whether or not they are receiving a final grade toward their GPA or receiving a P/F.  The final make-up of the grade will be decided by the faculty.

##### Grading will be based on:

* **Participation**: This is more than just attendance, this includes active interaction in discussions and group work.

* **Quality of work & process**: Showing a successful design process (which culminates in fine work) is the standard.

* **Attendance & Due Dates**: Attendance and submissions will be recorded and will be used in grading.

##### A note on group work

Group work is a basic part of life and grading is comprised of two parts: **the individual** and **the group**.  Each is assessed based on both the ideal (ex. the quality of the work) as well as the mitigating circumstances (ex. group dynamic/abiliteis).  *Weight will be given toward the quality of the group work.*

In the end, group work will be successful if every group member does to the best of *their own abilities*.  This **does not** mean that all work will be split equally, it means that **the work** has to get done, somehow, someway.

### Academic Integrity

The purpose of education is promote and expand the truth.  Collaboration and building off the work of others are, of course, the corner-stones of academic research, but must be used with integrity.  Thus, all work must be presented with *honesty* as the foundational criterion.

Students must:

* Appropriately cite any and all work (papers, images, videos, etc.) that contributed toward their work.

* Properly acknowledge collaboration (of any type) that contributed toward their work.

* Request information from faculty regarding questions before submission of work.

Any act of plagiarism, cheating, or other act of academic dishonesty will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, but may be considered a serious offense.

Any questions about citation, research, or those in regards to this policy should be referred to ```fablab@cept.ac.in```.

*This policy is heavily influenced by those of MIT (Cambridge, MA).  For more information see ```integrity.mit.edu```.*


### Code of Conduct

All students (and others) are required to treat themselves, those around them, their environment with the upmost respect.  Discrimination, harassment, violance, etc. of any kind, is unacceptable and **will be handled with all seriousness**.  

Any questions in regards to this policy should be referred to ```fablab@cept.ac.in```.
